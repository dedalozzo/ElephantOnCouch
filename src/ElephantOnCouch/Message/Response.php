  //! @name Response Header Fields
  //@{

  //! @brief The Accept-Ranges response-header field allows the server to indicate its acceptance of range requests for
  //! a resource.
  //! @see http://www.w3.org/cols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.5
  const ACCEPT_RANGES_HF = "Accept-Ranges";

  //! @brief The Age response-header field conveys the sender's estimate of the amount of time since the response (or its
  //! revalidation) was generated at the origin server. A cached response is "fresh" if its age does not exceed its
  //! freshness lifetime.
  //! @see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.6
  const AGE_HF = "Age";

  //! @brief In order to force the browser to show SaveAs dialog when clicking a hyperlink you have to include this
  //! header field.
  const CONTENT_DISPOSITION_HF = "Content-Disposition";

  //! @brief An identifier for a specific version of a resource, often a message digest.
  //! @see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.19
  const ETAG_HF = "ETag";

  //! has been created.
  //! @see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.30
  const LOCATION_HF = "Location";

  //! @brief This header is supposed to set P3P policy, in the form of P3P:CP="your_compact_policy". However, P3P did not
  //! take off, most browsers have never fully implemented it, a lot of websites set this header with fake policy text,
  //! that was enough to fool browsers the existence of P3P policy and grant permissions for third party cookies.
  //! @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P3P
  const P3P_HF = "P3P";

  //! @brief Request authentication to access the proxy.
  //! @see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.33
  const PROXY_AUTHENTICATE_HF = "Proxy-Authenticate";

  //! @brief Used in redirection, or when a new resource has been created. This refresh redirects after 5 seconds. This is
  //! a proprietary, non-standard header extension introduced by Netscape and supported by most web browsers.
  //! @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_refresh
  const REFRESH_HF = "Refresh";

  //! @brief If an entity is temporarily unavailable, this instructs the client to try again after a specified period of time (seconds).
  //! @see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.37
  const RETRY_AFTER_HF = "Retry-After";

  //! @see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.38
  const SERVER_HF = "Server";

  //! @brief Sets an HTTP Cookie.
  //! @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie
  const SET_COOKIE_HF = "Set-Cookie";

  //! @brief A HSTS Policy informing the HTTP client how long to cache the HTTPS only policy and whether this applies to
  //! subdomains.
  //! @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security
  const STRICT_TRANSPORT_SECURITY_HF = "Strict-Transport-Security";

  //! @brief Tells downstream proxies how to match future request headers to decide whether the cached response can be
  //! used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin server.
  //! @see http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.44
  const VARY_HF = "Vary";

  //! @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking
  const X_FRAME_OPTIONS_HF = "X-Frame-Options";

  //! @brief Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter.
  //! @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting
  const X_XSS_PROTECTION_HF = "X-XSS-Protection";

  //! @brief The only defined value, "nosniff", prevents Internet Explorer from MIME-sniffing a response away from the
  //! declared content-type.
  const X_CONTENT_TYPE_OPTIONS_HF = "X-Content-Type-Options";

  //! @brief A de facto standard for identifying the originating protocol of an HTTP request, since a reverse proxy (load
  //! balancer) may communicate with a web server using HTTP even if the request to the reverse proxy is HTTPS.
  const X_FORWARDED_PROTO_HF = "X-Forwarded-Proto";

  //! @brief Specifies the technology (e.g. ASP.NET, PHP, JBoss) supporting the web application (version details are often
  //! in X-Runtime, X-Version, or X-AspNet-Version)
  const X_POWERED_BY_HF = "X-Powered-By";

  //! @brief Recommends the preferred rendering engine (often a backward-compatibility mode) to use to display the content.
  //! Also used to activate Chrome Frame in Internet Explorer.

  //! @}

  //! @name Success Status Codes
  //@{

  //! @brief Request is OK, entity body contains requested resource.
  const OK_SC = 200;

  //! @brief For requests that create server objects (e.g., PUT).
  //! @details The entity body of the response should contain the various URLs for referencing the created resource,
  //! with the Location header containing the most specific reference.
  const CREATED_SC = 201;

  //! @brief The request was accepted, but the server has not yet performed any action with it.
  //! @details There are no guarantees that the server will complete the request; this just means that the request
  //! looked valid when accepted.
  const ACCEPTED_SC = 202;

  //! @brief The information contained in the entity headers came not from the origin server but from a copy of the resource.
  //! @details This could happen if an intermediary had a copy of a resource but could not or did not validate the
  //! meta-information (headers) it sent about the resource.
  const NONAUTHORITATIVE_INFORMATION_SC = 203;

  //! @brief The response message contains headers and a status line, but no entity body.
  //! @details Primarily used to update browsers without having them move to a new document.
  const NO_CONTENT_SC = 204;

  //! @brief Another code primarily for browsers. Tells the browser to clear any HTML form elements on the current page.
  const RESET_CONTENT_SC = 205;

  //! @brief A partial or range request was successful.
  //! @details Later, we will see that clients can request part or a range of a document by using special headersï¿½this
  //! status code indicates that the range request was successful.
  //! A 206 response must include a Content-Range, Date, and either ETag or Content-Location header.
  const PARTIAL_CONTENT_SC = 206;

  //! @}

  //! @name Redirection Status Codes
  //@{

  //! @brief Returned when a client has requested a URL that actually refers to multiple resources.
  //! @details Multiple resources such as a server hosting an English and French version of an HTML document.
  //! This code is returned along with a list of options; the user can then select which one he wants.
  const MULTIPLE_CHOICES_SC = 300;

  //! @brief Used when the requested URL has been moved.
  //! @details The response should contain in the Location header the URL where the resource now resides.
  const MOVED_PERMANENTLY_SC = 301;

  //! @brief Like the 301 status code.
  //! @details However, the client should use the URL given in the Location header to locate the resource temporarily.
  //! Future requests should use the old URL.
  const FOUND_SC = 302;

  //! @brief Used to tell the client that the resource should be fetched using a different URL.
  //! @details This new URL is in the Location header of the response message. Its main purpose is to allow responses to
  //! POST requests to direct a client to a resource.
  const SEE_OTHER_SC = 303;

  //! @brief Clients can make their requests conditional by the request headers they include.
  //! @details If a client makes a conditional request, such as a GET if the resource has not been changed recently,
  //! this code is used to indicate that the resource has not changed. Responses with this status code should not
  //! contain an entity body.
  const NOT_MODIFIED_SC = 304;

  //! @brief Used to indicate that the resource must be accessed through a proxy.
  //! @details The location of the proxy is given in the Location header. It's important that clients interpret
  //! this response relative to a specific resource and do not assume that this proxy should be used for all
  //! requests or even all requests to the server holding the requested resource.
  //! This could lead to broken behavior if the proxy mistakenly interfered with a request, and it poses a security hole.
  const USE_PROXY_SC = 305;

  //! @brief Not currently used.
  const UNUSED_SC = 306;

  //! @brief Like the 301 status code.
  //! @details However, the client should use the URL given in the Location header to locate the resource temporarily.
  //! Future requests should use the old URL.

  //! @brief Currently this status code is not used, but it has been set aside for future use.
  const PAYMENT_REQUIRED_SC = 402;

  //! @brief Used to indicate that the request was refused by the server.
  //! @details If the server wants to indicate why the request was denied, it can include an entity body describing the
  //! reason. However, this code usually is used when the server does not want to reveal the reason for the refusal.
  const FORBIDDEN_SC = 403;

  //! @brief Used to indicate that the server cannot find the requested URL.
  //! @details Often, an entity is included for the client application to display to the user.
  const NOT_FOUND_SC = 404;

  //! @brief Used when a request is made with a method that is not supported for the requested URL.
  //! @details The Allow header should be included in the response to tell the client what methods are allowed on the
  //! requested resource.
  const METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED_SC = 405;

  //! @brief Clients can specify parameters about what types of entities they are willing to accept.
  //! @details This code is used when the server has no resource matching the URL that is acceptable for the client.
  //! Often, servers include headers that allow the client to figure out why the request could not be satisfied.
  const NOT_ACCEPTABLE_SC = 406;

  //! @brief Like the 401 status code, but used for proxy servers that require authentication for a resource.
  const PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED_SC = 407;

  //! @brief If a client takes too long to complete its request, a server can send back this status code and close down
  //! the connection.
  //! @details The length of this timeout varies from server to server but generally is long enough to accommodate any
  //! legitimate request.
  const REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SC = 408;

  //! @brief Used to indicate some conflict that the request may be causing on a resource.
  //! @details Servers might send this code when they fear that a request could cause a conflict. The response should
  //! contain a body describing the conflict.
  const CONFLICT_SC = 409;

  //! @brief Similar to 404, except that the server once held the resource.
  //! @details Used mostly for web site maintenance, so a server's administrator can notify clients when a resource has
  //! been removed.
  const GONE_SC = 410;

  //! @brief Used when the server requires a Content-Length header in the request message.
  const LENGTH_REQUIRED_SC = 411;

  //! @brief Used if a client makes a conditional request and one of the conditions fails.
  //! @details Conditional requests occur when a client includes an unexpected header.
  const PRECONDITION_FAILED_SC = 412;

  //! @brief Used when a client sends an entity body that is larger than the server can or wants to process.
  const REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE_SC = 413;

  //! @brief Used when a client sends a request with a request URL that is larger than the server can or wants to process.
  const REQUESTURI_TOO_LONG_SC = 414;

  //! @brief Used when a client sends an entity of a content type that the server does not understand or support.
  const UNSUPPORTED_MEDIA_TYPE_SC = 415;

  //! @brief Used when the request message requested a range of a given resource and that range either was invalid or
  //! could not be met.
  const REQUESTED_RANGE_NOT_SATISFIABLE_SC = 416;

  //! @brief Used when the request contained an expectation in the request header that the server could not satisfy.
  const EXPECTATION_FAILED_SC = 417;

  //! @}
  
  //! @name Server Error Status Codes
  //@{

  //! @brief Used when the server encounters an error that prevents it from servicing the request.
  const INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR_SC = 500;

  //! @brief Used when a client makes a request that is beyond the server's capabilities (e.g., using a request method
  //! that the server does not support).
  const NOT_IMPLEMENTED_SC = 501;

  //! @brief Used when a server acting as a proxy or gateway encounters a bogus response from the next link in
  //! the request response chain (e.g., if it is unable to connect to its parent gateway).
  const BAD_GATEWAY_SC = 502;

  //! @brief Used to indicate that the server currently cannot service the request but will be able to in the future.
  //! @details If the server knows when the resource will become available, it can include a Retry-After header in the
  //! response.
  const SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE_SC = 503;

  //! @brief Similar to status code 408, except that the response is coming from a gateway or proxy that has
  //! timed out waiting for a response to its request from another server.
  const GATEWAY_TIMEOUT_SC = 504;

  //! @brief Used when a server receives a request in a version of the protocol that it can't or won't support.
